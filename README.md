NLP-related data science projects

### 1. Predict real twitts
This notebook uses FastText to create a model that can predict whether a given twitt is based on real or fake news.

### 2. Predict Engagement Internet News
This notebook creates different predictive models to predict the probability of an Internet article being ignored by receiving zero comments, shares, or likes.
I use 3 different methods: 
1- FastText
2- TF-IDF Vectorizer (Sklearn)
3- TF-IDF Vectorizer + LightGBM
